Checkmate: a to-do list to help you get things done!  
  

## description  
  * built as a fun project to practice using what I've learned to date  
  * an assignment in The Odin Project's "Javascript Course"  
    
### goals  
  * dynamically create objects ("to-dos")  
  * include properties: title, priority level, due date, notes, and project  
  * UI: able to view all, expand a to-do, edit details, delete  
  * UI: navbar to sort by due date, priority, today/week, and by project  
  * keep app logic separate from DOM-related content  
  * modularize project, minimize global variables
  * utilize webpack (second project ever)  
  * learn how to work with dates (date-fns was helpful!)  
  * learn & deploy local storage functionality

# [Checkmate](https://connorwarme.github.io/toDo/): a to-do list app   
  
![title](https://github.com/connorwarme/toDo/blob/main/screenshots/title.png?raw=true "title") 
  
## description  
  * built as a fun project to practice using what I've learned to date  
  * an assignment in The Odin Project's "Javascript Course"  
    
## goals  
  * dynamically create objects ("to-dos")  
  * include properties: title, priority level, due date, notes, and project  
  * UI: able to view all, expand a to-do, edit details, delete  
  * UI: navbar to sort by due date, priority, today/week, and by project  
  * keep app logic separate from DOM-related content  
  * modularize project, minimize global variables
  * utilize webpack (second project ever)  
  * learn how to work with dates (date-fns was helpful!)  
  * learn & deploy local storage functionality  
  * responsiveness to different viewing sizes (still isn't mobile friendly unfortunately)

## screenshots  
  
  * a glimpse at the page as a whole:  
  ![todo](https://github.com/connorwarme/toDo/blob/main/screenshots/to-do.png?raw=true "to-do app")  

  * demo mode, with to-dos sorted by priority:  
  ![list](https://github.com/connorwarme/toDo/blob/main/screenshots/list.png?raw=true "list of to-dos")  

  * the navbar, with 3 sections: Home, Sort By (currently by priority), and Projects:  
  ![navbar](https://github.com/connorwarme/toDo/blob/main/screenshots/navbar.png?raw=true "navbar")  

## ideas to improve  
  * mobile-friendly UI  
  * navbar projects: an option to edit (instead of simply deleting the project)  
  * bug: when you create multiple empty to-dos, it alternates between edit mode and regular view
